Web-Dev
Welcome to my personal repository where I document and share the websites I‚Äôve created. This repository serves as a portfolio of my work, showcasing both past projects and those I‚Äôll be developing in the future.

Overview
This repository contains a collection of web development projects that I have built. Each project is housed in its own directory, along with its source code, assets, and any additional documentation required to run and understand the project.

Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to:
Document my web development journey: Keep track of the websites I‚Äôve worked on, demonstrating my progression in learning and applying various web development technologies.
Showcase my skills: Display my proficiency in building websites with technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and more, to potential employers, clients, or collaborators.
Encourage collaboration: Provide an open platform for fellow developers to explore, contribute to, and give feedback on my projects.
